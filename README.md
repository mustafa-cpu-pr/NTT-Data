# Internship Experience at NTT Data

## Overview
During my internship at NTT Data, I contributed to various development and automation projects involving data visualization, real-time UI integration, and system automation. Leveraging technologies like Go, Angular, Express, Node.js, Highcharts, and MongoDB, I developed tools to improve data handling and user interactivity. Each project emphasized a user-focused approach with secure, efficient backend solutions and real-time data processing, resulting in an enhanced user experience.

## Completed Tasks

- **TaskGo - Data Visualization Tool in Go (Golang)**: 
    - Developed an interactive data visualization tool using Go, focusing on pie charts, bar charts, and line charts for analyzing data.
    - Utilized libraries such as `gonum` and `go-echarts` to generate customizable and engaging visual representations, improving data insights and user engagement.

- **Task 1 - Data Table Integration with Angular**:
    - Integrated a dynamic data table in Angular that enables users to modify configurations such as data, grouping, and CSS from the UI.
    - Used Express and Node.js to build APIs with Postman for testing, allowing data updates to reflect in real time on the table, providing a responsive user experience.

- **Task 2 - Highcharts Integration in Angular for Packed Bubble Chart**:
    - Integrated Highcharts in Angular to create a packed bubble chart, where users could configure series colors and data from the UI.
    - Built API endpoints using Express and Node.js to handle data requests, with Postman used for testing, enabling instant updates and an interactive chart experience.

- **Task 3 - Highcharts Integration in Angular for Heatmap Tilemap**:
    - Developed a heatmap tilemap in Angular using Highcharts, allowing configuration of chart features like color schemes and data points from the UI.
    - Supported the front end with API development in Express and Node.js, with testing in Postman, providing users real-time interaction with the chart.

- **Task 4 - Automated MongoDB Backup and Restoration**:
    - Created an automated solution for MongoDB backup and restoration, using Python and shell scripting.
    - This solution streamlined backup processes, ensuring data safety and reducing manual intervention.

- **Task 5 - Voice Recognition Module in Angular**:
    - Built a voice recognition module using the Web Speech API in Angular, with real-time transcription and dynamic UI updates.
    - Implemented status updates for listening mode, providing a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Tech Stack

The internship involved the following technologies and tools:

- **Programming Languages**: 
    - **Go**: For building the data visualization tool with interactive charting.
    - **JavaScript (Angular)**: For dynamic UI components and Highcharts and Web Speech API integrations.
    - **Python**: For scripting automated MongoDB backup and restoration.
  
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
    - **Angular**: For front-end UI components, integrated with data tables and Highcharts.
    - **Express.js**: For building RESTful APIs to manage data and interactions between Angular components and the backend.
    - **Node.js**: As the runtime environment for server-side code, enabling efficient backend processing and API handling.
    - **MongoDB**: For data storage and backup automation.
    - **Highcharts**: Used in multiple tasks for packed bubble and heatmap tilemap charts with real-time configuration.
    - **gonum** and **go-echarts**: For data manipulation and chart generation in Golang.
  
- **Tools**:
    - **Postman**: Used for API testing and validation during development of Express and Node.js endpoints.
    - **Web Speech API**: For real-time voice recognition and transcription in Angular.
    - **Shell Scripting**: For automating data backup processes.

## Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Develop the Golang-based data visualization tool with interactive and intuitive charting options.
2. **Phase 2**: Complete Angular integrations for data tables and Highcharts with dynamic real-time updates.
3. **Phase 3**: Implement MongoDB backup and restoration automation, reducing manual data management.
4. **Phase 4**: Develop the voice recognition module with responsive UI elements, enhancing accessibility and interactivity.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements and extensions for the tasks completed include:

- **Expanded Charting Options**: Introduce additional chart types and customizable themes in the Go visualization tool.
- **Enhanced Backup Solutions**: Implement version control within MongoDB backups for easier point-in-time recovery.
- **Advanced Voice Recognition Features**: Integrate language options and natural language processing for enhanced accuracy and usability in the voice recognition module.
